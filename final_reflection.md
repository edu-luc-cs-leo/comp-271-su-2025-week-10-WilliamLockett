# COMP 271 COURSE REFLECTION

During my time in COMP 271, I tried to be in class as much as I could. I believe I only missed 3 classes due to me having to take the train to Minnesota for jury duty and taking my girlfriend to the hospital. I would join class on time, usually a couple minutes early. I was free of all distractions and the class always had my full attention. I tried to answer all the questions that came my way but some of them I just did not know. If I could not answer the question then I would study it more on my own time, for example, when I was asked about linked lists but my mind completely blanked on it, after that I went and googled it and read more about it.

I improved a lot throughout this course and have used the reflections to improve the most. To name a time the reflection helped, I remember that for one of the assignments you had used String Builder, before we talked about it in class, so then I wrote in my reflection that I would try to use it in the next assignment and I did. Theres a lot that I have learned throughout the course, especially with nodes & arrays. For some of these assignments, I would get really confused. I had to ask ChatGPT to explain somethings to me or just google it. Even with all the confusion, I believe every single one of my assignments worked and followed the Programmers Pact.

Going into this course, I hadn't taken a computer science class in a semester so I was a bit rusty at the start. Knowing this I would frequently ask ChatGPT questions about some of the stuff we were talking about, I would read the study part of the assignment, and I would google questions I had. I put in hours outside of class time but I could've put more effort into becoming the best programmer I could possibly be, however, now knowing this information, I have a better understanding of what I will do to continually improve.



 Based on the above, I propose B as my final grade.
